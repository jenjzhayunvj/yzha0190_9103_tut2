## PART1:
The Packed Pavilion, shown at a paper-art exhibition in Shanghai at the close of World Expo 2010, which authors wrote a computer program that allowed the cones to combine with each other through a 3D circle packing process.
The main water sports venues for the 2008 Beijing Olympics, the Water Cube’s shell adopts the Weaire–Phelan foam, yielding irregular polygons (triangles, quadrilaterals, heptagons). 
Building on these precedents, I want to re-express “Wheels of Fortune” in 3D, based on circle packing. Adding shallow 3D forms heightens light–shadow contrast and rhythmic density, improving readability and immersion.

## PART2:
This random line expression technique is generally called "Random Walk" in coding. The "Random Walk" mechanism allows lines to randomly extend from one point to the next, thus generating intricate, tortuous paths. As Dhruv Karan shows in p5.js generation art, random walks combined with Perlin noise can achieve a balance between "random" and "order", making the lines both free and beautiful. The “Random Walkers” tutorial of Generative Hut also points out that by controlling parameters such as step size, direction probability, and boundary rebound, the degree of chaos can be controlled, so that the work is dynamic and not completely messy.
